# MokeSell E-commerce Website

This project is a simple e-commerce website called MokeSell, featuring product listings, filtering, details, and a basic shopping cart functionality.

## Project Overview

MokeSell allows users to browse products, filter them by category, view product details, and add items to their cart.  The site uses dynamic content loading for product details and a modal for the shopping cart.

## Features

*   **Product Listings:** Displays products with images, names, prices, and usage information.
*   **Category Filtering:** Allows users to filter products by category (All, Computer & Tech, Mobile Phones & Gadgets, Video Gamings, TV and Home Application).
*   **Search Functionality:** Enables users to search for products by name.
*   **Product Details:** Provides a dedicated page (`cart1.html`) to view detailed information about a specific product, including multiple images and key features.
*   **Shopping Cart:** A modal-based shopping cart allows users to see the items they've added.  (Note:  Cart persistence and actual purchase functionality are not implemented in this version.)
*   **Dynamic Content Loading:** Product details are loaded dynamically using JavaScript and fetched from a JSON file (`products.json`).
*   **Image Carousel:** An image carousel on the homepage showcases featured products or promotions.
*   **Like Functionality:** Users can "like" products, and the like count is displayed.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Structure and content of the web pages.
*   **CSS:** Styling and layout.
*   **JavaScript:** Dynamic functionality, including filtering, search, dynamic product details loading, and cart interaction.
*   **Bootstrap:**  Used for responsive layout and pre-built UI components (modals, buttons, etc.).
*   **Bootstrap Icons:** Provides icons for the user interface.
*   **JSON:** Product data is stored and retrieved from a JSON file (`products.json`).
